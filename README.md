#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is a descipline focused on the systematic development of high quality software products  using engineering principles, methods and tools.

Its importance in technology industry is: it ensures the creation of high-quality, scalable, and secure software that meets the needs of users and businesses. It drives innovation, supports economic growth, and enables businesses to thrive in an increasingly digital world.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
   This introduced the use of control structures like loops, conditionals, and subroutines, which made code more readable, maintainable and less prone to errors.This milestone laid the 
   foundation for modern programming languages (such as C, Pascal, and Ada) and introduced concepts that are still fundamental in software engineering today.
2. The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)
   OOP revolutionized software development by introducing the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.
3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s)
   Agile methodologies emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional waterfall development models. Agile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, flexibility, and 
   customer feedback


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design - Creating high level and system designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation - Writing code and building the software according to the design specification.
4. Testing - Conducting various test to the software and ensuring it meets quality standardsand functional requirements.
5. Deployment - Releasing the softwareto users or customers.
6. Maintainance - Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is rigid and follows a strict sequence, making it suitable for projects with fixed requirements and a need for thorough documentation and testing while Agile is flexible and iterative, allowing for continuous adaptation, making it suitable for projects where requirements are likely to change or where ongoing customer feedback is essential.
Examples include:
- Developing software for a medical device where requirements are fixed by regulatory bodies. In such cases, a clear, documented plan and thorough testing are required before moving forward, making Waterfall a suitable choice
- Developing a mobile app for a startup where user feedback is critical, and requirements may evolve. Agile allows the team to quickly adapt to user preferences, market changes, or new ideas, making it ideal for such dynamic environments.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software soltions.
2. Quality Assuarance engineeer ensures software quality by designing and excuting test plans.
3. Project manager oversees the planning , excecution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing debugging and testing code. Examples Visual Studio and eclipse
VSC are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples git and subversion. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some challenges include:
1. Changing requirements
2. tight deadlines
3. Technical debt
Strategies for overcoming the challenges include:
- Effective communication
- Prioritization of tasks
- Agile methologies


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Intergration testing involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing involves testing the software system against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs given to AI models, especially language models like GPT, to elicit desired responses.
It ensures that interactions are productive, relevant, and aligned with the user’s goals, enhancing the overall effectiveness of AI tools in various applications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry over the past decade.
The improved prompt is more effective because it reduces ambiguity, allowing the AI to deliver a precise and informative response tailored to the user’s specific interest. It saves time and provides relevant information directly related to the user's query, making the interaction more efficient and productive
